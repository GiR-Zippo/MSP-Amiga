# My Shitty Player
just a test how to NOT build a audioplayer for an Amiga

## Compiling:
If you are using beppos crosscompiler set USE_ADE = 0 in MakeFile

The compiler can be obtained here
https://github.com/AmigaPorts/m68k-amigaos-gcc

You can also compile via ADE native on your Amiga set USE_ADE = 1 in MakeFile
Be awe this will take some time, grab a coffee and compile
